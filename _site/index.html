<p><strong>Hey Techies,</strong></p>

<p>We are happy that you are interested and joined our between-semester program. Now that you have finished your Digital Shaper projects, you have realised that developing data science solutions takes longer then expected and that you would like to become faster and improve your knowledge in data science. This is what the Data Science Accelerator is for, to accelerate your data science skills! The Data Science Accelerator will give you a deeper understanding of Python &amp; Data Science, as well as a sneak peek for your next steps as data scientist: Artifical Intelligence.</p>

<p>Based on these, the track is seperated into three parts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Python Deep-Dive</p>

    <p>Data Science is like every craft: The better you know your tools, the faster and better are your results. The main tool you will be using for data science will be Python and its various libraries, so learning more about them will accelerate your data science skills, by quite a bit! This section won`t be an introduction into Python, instead we will build on your foundation and introduce more complex &amp; powerful topics.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Data Science Deep-Dive</p>

    <p>What is the second best way of getting faster and better in data science, after learning more about Python? The answer is <em>more</em> data science. Just as in the previous section, we will build on your existing skill set and dive deeper into data science. While a big part of data science is about coding and models, we will also introduce more soft topics of data science, such as how to define a data science problem and how to communicate with your non-ds team mates.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Artifical Intelligence Sneak Peek</p>

    <p>While the differences are not always clear, and many people (especially the ones who don`t know anything about tech) will use them interchangable, AI is nothing else then a subgroup of data science. You feed a model some data, and it will be able to predict some output. To give you a better insight, that it is not magic we will give you a sneak peak into this whole field.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Before you start learning the real material, please go through our introduction docuemnts to get you into the right mindset, to see what is the difference between the digital shaper program and the accelerator and how to set up your working environment.</p>

<p>Hope you have a great time</p>

<p>Merlin &amp; Max!</p>
